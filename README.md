## Main features

 - Simulating hundreds of fog and cloud nodes
    * Measuring energy consumption of the nodes
 - Simulating IoT applications utilising the physical resources by virtual machines 
    * Measuring makespan of the IoT applications
 - Modelling thousands of IoT devices and sensors 
    * Measuring energy consumption of the IoT devices 
    * Detailed sensor characteristics
 - Modelling IoT actuator events and IoT device mobility
    * Sensor characteristics and device behaviour manipulation
    * Device position and network connection manipulation
 - Considering device strategies to map an IoT device to an IoT application 
 - Considering IoT application strategies to determine task allocations on the nodes
 - Using exisiting IoT trace files to ensure a more realistic simulation
 - Calculating IoT and cloud/fog side utilising costs by considering real provider schemas such as
    * AWS, Microsoft Azure, IBM Cloud, Oracle Cloud
 - Providing XML based configuration options
